# a_random_quote_generator-v1
 First random quote generator application.
 Displays random quotes from a fixed set.  All display quote and source, While some also display one or more of citation, date and link to buy the book from which the quote originated.

 A new quote is displayed onscreen whenever the "Show another quote" button is clicked or every 10 seconds which ever is sooner.
 A button click doesn't reset the 10 second timer.
 Due to the random nature of quote selection, a different quote isn't guaranteed every time the button is clicked or quote is refreshed.  
 Likewise colour selection is random and not guaranteed to be different, however consecutive identical colour values is highly unlikely, so it's expected that the same quote will be displayed on refresh/button click often but the background colour will rarely also be identical.
